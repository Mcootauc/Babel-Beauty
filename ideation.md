Which audiences did you consider, and which one did you settle on for your app?

We considered college students, teens, and adults. For our app, we decided to settle on our audience being adults, specifically those who live alone.

List the ten needs that you identified for your chosen audience

Food, Time Management, Organization, News, Leisure, Entertainment (Shows, etc), Music, Art inspiration, Fashion, Fitness

State the three needs that were chosen out of the ten, and state the projects that you mapped to those needs

The three needs we chose were: Food, Time Management, and Fitness. The projects that we mapped to these needs were the following: A cookbook (food), Schedule creator (time management), and a Exercise tracker (fitness).

For each of the three projects, list the goals/ideas that you brainstormed for them
  
  Food: A cookbook that allows users to have access to an index of recipes to follow, can store blogs with experiences with recipes, etc.
  
  Schedule creator: A schedule to allow users to keep track of activites they need to do today. Saved through a database
  
  Excerise tracker: A record with information about excerises done (both sets and reps) per day. Addiional tab to track macros. Saved through a database

State the “winner” of this process

The winner of this process that we concluded was the Food app.

Expounded Ideas for Food App:
  
  Possible name: Bable Cookbook
  
  Structure: Two tabs, (1) List of all recipies given in API (most likely going to use TheMealDB) filtering by category of food, (2) Database of all recipe reviews made
  
  (1) Full listt of recipes can be sorted by specific categories (Chicken, seafood, etc.), upon choosing a recipe, the entire ingredient and instruction list will be made. At the bottom of the recipe, there would be a button that would redirect users to write a review of the recipe that they followed.
