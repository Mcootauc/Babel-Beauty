Which audiences did you consider, and which one did you settle on for your app?

We considered college students and teens. For our app, we decided to settle on our audience being college students.

List the ten needs that you identified for your chosen audience

Food, Time Management, Organization, News, Leisure, Entertainment (Shows, etc), Music, Art inspiration, Fashion, Fitness

State the three needs that were chosen out of the ten, and state the projects that you mapped to those needs

The three needs we chose were: Food, Time Management, and Fitness. The projects that we mapped to these needs were the following: A cookbook (food), Schedule creator (time management), and a Exercise tracker (fitness).

For each of the three projects, list the goals/ideas that you brainstormed for them
  Food: A cookbook that allows users to have access to an index of recipes to follow, can store blogs with experiences with recipes, etc.
  
  Schedule creator: A schedule to allow users to keep track of activites they need to do today. Saved through a database
  
  Excerise tracker: A record with information about excerises done (both sets and reps) per day. Addiional tab to track macros. Saved through a database

State the “winner” of this process

The winner of this process that we concluded was the Food app.
