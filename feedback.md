| | **Baseline functionality** | |
| • Third-party web service API | Third-party API is successfully integrated with the exception of search: the `brand` parameter appears to work, but `name` does not, even in Postman (–2) | 23/25 |
| • Authentication | Authentication is done via Firebase email auth | 10/10 |
| • Database | Database use is derived from blog code, with no additional features from the Bare Bones version<br><br>So although database use is indeed present, it would be unfair to give this work the same credit as other groups, which expanded database use more substantially from the prior assignment (–5) | 21/25 |
| | **Implementation specifications** | |
| • Model objects | Model objects look appropriate, although the Article model doesn’t add anything from the starter code. Fortunately, Makeup “makes up” for that 🥁 | 8/8 |
| • Interaction with back-end | App interaction with the back end is by-and-large successful, although the `refreshable` modifier does not adequately handle the async function (–2) | 10/12 |
| • Abstraction of back-end | Interactions with the back end are abstracted sufficiently | 12/12 |
| • Feedback | In-progress feedback is rendered in appropriate situations | 7/7 |
| • Error-handling | Errors are caught and rendered for the user if they occur | 7/7 |
| • Layout and composition | Layout feels appropriate for the app although it feels disjointed: the Cosmetic Library is completely disconnected from Reviews, despite some expectation that reviews would be associated with a specific product. Some kind of closer association (for example, placing the reviews within the product detail, ideally filtered by product) seems to align with the app’s goals better (–1)<br><br>Further, a highly visible makeup property, _brand_, is not expressly displayed in the list or detail views at all. This is a disconnect from the search field—unless the user is already an expert on makeup brands, how would they know which brands they can potentially search for? (–1) | 5/7 |
| • Colors and other visuals | Comsetic Library is pretty derivative of the iTunes tab from APIdex, but then again this kind of view is also pretty standard. But nice touches in the Reviews section with the color choices and shape highlight | 7/7 |
| • Input views and controls | Control are generally chosen and implemented appropriately, although for the Cosmetic Library, coordination between the NavigationView and the Picker can be better: when the NavigationView is look at a detail and the Picker selection changes, one would expect the NavigationView to switch back to the list because the Picker selection will load something new (–1) | 6/7 |
| • Animations/transitions | Custom animation seen in makeup detail view toggle | 5/5 |
| • Programmed graphics | Beauty reviews have a simple but fairly well-chosen triangle highlight | 5/5 |
| • Custom app icon | Custom app icon is custom | 3/3 |
| | **Other categories** | |
| Code maintainability | No notable maintainability issues seen |  |
| Code readability | Some commented-out code lingers—commented-out code has temporary value while working on unfinalized things but in the end, they can be safely cleaned out without losing anything (thanks to version control), so that should have been done here. Keeping it around makes the code harder to read (–2) | -2 |
| Version control | Commit activity has sufficient frequency and messages are adequately descriptive. Commits appear to only be made by Sebastian and Erin but I didn’t hear about any team equitability issues so we’ll just chalk this up to your work style |  |
| Punctuality | First commit 4/19 9:58am; last commit 5/4 9:20pm. On time |  |
| | **Total** | **237/250** |
